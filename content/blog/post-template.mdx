The expression `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3` evaluates to `true` in JavaScript due to the imprecision of floating-point arithmetic. Here's why:

- In JavaScript, numbers are represented in binary floating-point format, which can lead to precision issues, especially with decimals.
- The numbers `0.1` and `0.2` do not have exact binary representations, so when they are added together, the result is not exactly `0.3` but rather a close approximation.
- This results in the sum being slightly more than `0.3`, such as `0.30000000000000004`.
- The strict inequality `!==` checks for both value and type equality, and since the actual sum is not exactly `0.3`, it returns `true`.

This is why comparisons of floating-point numbers in JavaScript (and many other programming languages) should be done with a threshold of precision, often called "epsilon".

## Blockquotes

> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

```js /age/#v /name/#v /setAge/#s /setName/#s /50/#i /'Taylor'/#i
const [age, setAge] = useState(50);
const [name, setName] = useState("Taylor");
```

  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
    For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
    with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
    in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
    Halloween.
  </p>
  <p>
    But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
    series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
