Next.js Conf is an annual gathering for all of us React and Next.js fans, bringing a fresh wave of features and improvements to explore. Last year's introduction of Next.js 13 with its App router architecture, server component support, and exciting new features was a lot to take in. I've spent quite some time mastering these updates, and now I'm ready for the next big thing!

## Next.js 14 is here!! 🚀

This year, we've got more exciting updates in our beloved React framework:

- 🎯 **No New APIs**: Sticking to the basics, focusing on what matters!
- 🚀 **Turbopack**: Impressive! 5,000 tests passed for App & Pages Router.
- ✨ **Server Actions** (Stable): Mutations just got a whole lot smoother.
- 🌟 **Partial Prerendering** (Preview): Quick static responses with dynamic content? Yes, please!
- 📚 **Next.js Learn** (New): Ready to learn? A free, comprehensive course on the latest Next.js App Router, authentication, databases, and more.

Eager to get my hands on these new features / improvements and share my insights with you [here](/blog) 🤓!

## Community and Personal Moments 📖

### The Conference Experience:

This year's conference was filled with insightful talks about Next.js in action. From AI, to the web, to optimization, performance and more... all with practical implementations and unique use cases, this year's talks were a treasure trove of insights.

Couldn't join live? No worries! All talks are available on [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBnKlKpPeagl57K9bCw_IXShWQXePnXjY&si=jSZ1LLaF2oh3mxiA) at Vercel's YouTube channel.

### A Personal Highlight:

Let me share a little story from the conference day...

**`Picture this`** ... Racing home after a full day at work (CET Timezone), a hectic commute, battling metro issues ... just to catch the conference (live at 10am PT).

> That's me, eager as ever!

I tuned in mid-commute, catching [Guillermo Rauch's keynote](https://youtu.be/gfU1iZnjRZM?si=fVidVeujg4_wSe3R&t=804), but the real shocker came later 🤫...

Settling in at home, scrolling Twitter (X), I stumbled upon a post by [Smakosh](https://smakosh.com) featuring community members and educators at the keynote, and **there I was!** My face, up there with those contributing to the Next.js community! 🎉

> A recognition on a global stage! 🌟🌍

Witness this unexpected moment:

  <ReactTweet id={"1717609354147365111"} />
</div>

This **recognition** is a huge motivation boost. It's a testament to my love for what I do: `Engineering`, `Educating`, and `Entertaining`!

My journey with Next.js has been filled with [open source](/oss) projects, [speaking](/talks) at events, and teaching about the new App Router architecture.

## Many Thanks from me, Kawtar CHOUBARI 💖

Big thanks to the entire community. Special shoutout to the Vercel team, and the folks behind Next.js and React for their invaluable educational resources.

And for anyone wanting to get started or brush up on Next.js, Check out the newly updated tutorials at [Next.js Learn](https://nextjs.org/learn). They will help you learn the foundations while building a fully functional demo website that uses all the latest features.

There's so much more to learn together. Can't wait to share more in my upcoming posts. Keep an eye out!
