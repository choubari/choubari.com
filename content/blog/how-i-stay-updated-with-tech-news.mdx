As someone [deeply embedded](/creator) in the tech world, I have my own ways of staying updated. While I use all the methods I'm about to share, there's one I prefer the most. Let's explore these methods together, and by the end, I'll reveal my top pick.

## Method 1: Social Media

Social media is my go-to for getting quick updates. Platforms like Reddit and Twitter are where I follow tech figures, companies pages, and influencers. It's a great way to get diverse perspectives and instant news.

| **Advantages**                    | **Disadvantages**    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Instant news updates              | Information overload |
| Diverse perspectives              | Can be biased        |
| Adapted insights by the algorithm | Requires engagement  |

## Method 2: Tech Blogs & Newsletters

For more detailed insights, I turn to tech blogs and newsletters. They're perfect for in-depth analysis and further explanations. I make it a habit to check these during my commute or breakfast. Some of my favorites for broader insights include [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com), [Wired](https://www.wired.com) and [Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/).

And let's not forget the best curated Newsletter for React developers: [This week in React](https://thisweekinreact.com/).

| **Advantages**        | **Disadvantages**     |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| In-depth analysis     | Time-consuming        |
| Tailored to interests | Risk of email clutter |
| Regular updates       | Overwhelming          |

## Method 3: Browser Extensions

My **personal favorite** is the [Hackertab browser extension](http://hackertab.dev/), created by my friend [Mehdi](https://twitter.com/medyo80). It’s open-source, customizable, and integrates seamlessly into your daily browsing.

While [daily.dev](https://daily.dev) does the same, I find it more like a social network for tech, Hackertab offers a more focused approach. Here’s a quick comparison:

**Hackertab:**

- Customizable news feed, all in one menu
- Personalized sources with RSS feed updates
- Made by a friend, which adds a personal touch ✨

**daily.dev:**

- Broader range of tech news
- More community-driven
- Social network feel

I recently made a video demonstrating what I liked in Hackertab and how to use it ⬇️

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; fullscreen; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

| **Advantages**                      | **Disadvantages**                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Personalized news feed              | Limited to browser use (if not PWA) |
| Time-saving and convenient          | Requires initial setup              |
| Integrates with daily browsing flow | May miss out on social aspects      |

## How I use these methods effectively

While these tools help me stay informed, it's important to use them wisely ⚠️.

Balancing screen time and not getting **overwhelmed** is key, as we've seen with the recent Open AI drama... It's fun to watch, but it can be a major brain distraction, pulling our focus away from productive tasks and leading us down endless digital rabbit holes.

Algorithms can be your ally in getting meaningful recommendations, but remember to take breaks and manage your digital consumption.

## Conclusion

Staying updated in the tech world is crucial, and these methods have served me well. However, my top preference is [Hackertab](http://hackertab.dev/) for its simplicity.
